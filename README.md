# Mathematical Finance Cheat Sheet

A one page cheat sheet (double-sided) on some of the main tools and models used in Mathematical Finance. A 'Brownian Motion only' version can be found in this [branch](https://github.com/daleroberts/math-finance-cheat-sheet/tree/bm-only/). Download the [PDF](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/daleroberts/math-finance-cheat-sheet@master/math-finance-cheat-sheet.pdf), here is a thumbnail:

This cheat sheet is aimed for students and derivative-pricing quants that are interviewing. In fact, this is what I give my undergraduate students for their final exam. It has a stronger focus on interest-rate derivative results since most "Black Scholes" results are easily derived from scratch. Explicit pricing formulas (e.g., bonds or options under the Vasicek or CIR model) are not given as I typically assume they can also be derived as well (and they make fine exam questions).
